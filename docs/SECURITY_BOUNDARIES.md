## Approval Boundaries

### Owner Approval Required

| Action | Risk | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Create/modify secrets | high | Credential exposure |
| Create/modify API tokens | high | Credential exposure |
| Hetzner resource create/modify/delete | high | Financial |
| Cloudflare DNS/firewall changes | high | Availability |
| Production deployment | high | User-facing impact |
| Database migration | high | Data integrity |
| Repository publication | high | IP exposure |
| Credential rotation | high | Security |
| Medium/high-risk merge | medium | Code quality |
| Terraform apply | high | Infrastructure |
| Hetzner Firewall modify | high | Network security |

### Autonomous Actions Allowed

| Action | Risk | Safeguard |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Read files, git status | low | — |
| Create feature branches | low | Naming convention |
| Run local tests | low | No external side effects |
| Commit to feature branches | low | No direct push to main |
| Create low-risk PR | low | Auto-merge after CI |
| Update docs | low | — |
| Run smoke tests | low | Read-only |
| Generate reports | low | — |
| Create monitoring scripts | low | Local only |

## Network Boundaries

| Zone | Access | Services |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Public internet | Inbound: 22, 80, 443 | SSH, HTTP, HTTPS |
| Hetzner Private Network | Internal only | Hermes ↔ Staging |
| Staging internal | Docker network only | PostgreSQL (5432) |
| Hermes VPS | Full outbound | Orchestration, Telegram |

## Container Security

- Non-root containers
- Read-only filesystem where possible
- Drop capabilities
- no-new-privileges
- Health checks
- Resource limits
- Pinned base images (SHA)
- Multi-stage builds
- Secrets via environment (not layers)

## Supply Chain

- Third-party actions pinned by commit SHA
- Dependencies locked (lockfile)
- Trivy scan: critical/high block
- SBOM generated (CycloneDX/SPDX)
- Cosign keyless signing
- GitHub provenance attestation

## Incident Response

1. Detect: monitoring alert or test failure
2. Isolate: stop affected service
3. Assess: classify severity
4. Recover: rollback or restore
5. Notify: Telegram alert to owner
6. Post-mortem: document + ADR

## Secret Rotation

| Secret | Frequency | Method |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SSH keys | 90 days | New key + update authorized_keys |
| GitHub PAT | 90 days | Regenerate in GitHub settings |
| Cloudflare token | 180 days | Regenerate in dashboard |
| Linear API key | 180 days | Regenerate in dashboard |
| PostgreSQL passwords | 90 days | Update in container env |
| Telegram bot token | As needed | Regenerate via BotFather |
