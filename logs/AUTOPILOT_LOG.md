# Autopilot Log

## 2026-06-26T19:20:02Z

- Created initial project roadmap, autopilot state, decisions log, and autopilot log.
- Intent: establish minimal operating records for the first autopilot cycle.
- Follow-up: update this log after commit once a commit is explicitly approved and completed.

## 2026-06-26T19:20:54Z

- Committed initial autopilot files (ROADMAP.md, AUTOPILOT_STATE.md, docs/DECISIONS.md, logs/AUTOPILOT_LOG.md).
- Commit: ce1b4d3
- Next: run repository audit (list and classify files).

## 2026-06-26T19:35:46Z

- Created file inventory at audit/FILE_INVENTORY.md and committed (commit 6ec83a1).
- Updated ROADMAP.md and AUTOPILOT_STATE.md to record progress and next steps.
- Next: Analyze the inventory, rank gaps, and plan porting of core logic.

## 2026-06-26T22:47:00Z

- Attempted cycle: create partner profile template and update roadmap/state/log.
- Action: Created docs/PARTNER_PROFILE_TEMPLATE.md and updated ROADMAP.md and AUTOPILOT_STATE.md.
- Tests: not executed — pytest not installed in environment (BLOCKER).
- Commit: NOT CREATED (policy requires tests to run and pass before committing).
- Next: Install or enable test runner and re-run cycle to complete commit.

## 2026-06-26T23:06:58+03:00

- Action: Automated repository structure audit performed by night-shift autopilot.
- Files inspected: AGENTS.md, ROADMAP.md, AUTOPILOT_STATE.md, AUTOPILOT_PROMPT.md, logs/AUTOPILOT_LOG.md, audit/FILE_INVENTORY.md.
- Produced update: refreshed audit/FILE_INVENTORY.md with detected files and recommended next steps.
- Commit: created local commit (see commit hash in next message).
- Notes: No Dockerfile, no docker-compose.yml, no pyproject.toml, no requirements.txt, no top-level tests/ directory detected.
- Next: Create minimal smoke tests and CI workflow skeleton; consider Dockerfile template.

## 2026-06-27T00:00:00Z

- Action: Night-shift autopilot refreshed audit/FILE_INVENTORY.md and updated AUTOPILOT_STATE.md; created .autopilot.lock at cycle start.
- Files updated in working tree: audit/FILE_INVENTORY.md, AUTOPILOT_STATE.md, logs/AUTOPILOT_LOG.md, .autopilot.lock.
- Checks performed: enumerated files (depth=4), validated presence of CI skeleton and smoke test, checked key dependency/manifest files (none found).
- Outcome: repository `.git` is writable in this environment; smoke test exists but not yet executed in this run (next step). Preparing to run smoke tests and create a local commit if tests pass.

## 2026-06-27T01:50:59Z

- Action: Autopilot cycle 7 — selected the first logic source to port: the audit/file-inventory generator (audit/FILE_INVENTORY.md).
- Action: Wrote specification at docs/PORTING_FIRST_SOURCE.md describing inputs, outputs, and the minimal CLI surface for a tools/inventory.py implementation.
- Action: Updated ROADMAP.md and AUTOPILOT_STATE.md to record the selection and next steps.
- Tests: Ran smoke tests (bash tests/smoke_test.sh) — PASSED.
- Commit: created in this cycle (see local commit below).
- Next: Implement tools/inventory.py in a follow-up cycle and add a focused test that runs it on a small fixture.

## 2026-06-27T03:55:33+00:00

- Action: Autopilot cycle 7 (follow-up) — implemented tools/inventory.py and tests/test_inventory.sh per docs/PORTING_FIRST_SOURCE.md.
- Files created in working tree: tools/inventory.py, tests/test_inventory.sh.
- Tests executed: tests/test_inventory.sh (fixture-based inventory test) and tests/smoke_test.sh — both PASSED.
- Next: Wire tools/inventory.py into .github/workflows/smoke.yml for CI execution and add further focused tests.
- Commit: pending (local commit will be created to record these changes).

## 2026-06-27T04:39:08Z

## 2026-06-27T06:39:54Z

- Action: Wired tools/inventory.py into CI smoke workflow by adding an inventory execution step to .github/workflows/smoke.yml.
- Tests: Ran tools/inventory.py and tests/smoke_test.sh locally — PASSED.
- Files changed: .github/workflows/smoke.yml, audit/FILE_INVENTORY.md, AUTOPILOT_STATE.md, ROADMAP.md (if updated).
- Next: Add focused CI tests and dependency locking in a follow-up cycle.
- Commit: will be created locally in this cycle.

## 2026-06-27T08:43:43Z

- Action: Autopilot cycle 8 — added a focused pytest at tests/test_inventory_pytest.py to exercise tools/inventory.collect_files and render_inventory.
- Action detail: Created tests/test_inventory_pytest.py using Codex (sandbox: workspace-write).
- Verification: Attempted to run the new pytest but `pytest` is not installed in this environment; verification could not be completed.
- Files created (uncommitted): tests/test_inventory_pytest.py
- Blocker: `pytest` missing in runtime environment. Tests and local commit are deferred until pytest is available.
- Next: Run tests in an environment with pytest installed; if tests pass, create a local commit and append the commit hash to this log entry.


## 2026-06-27T10:46:52Z

- Action: Autopilot cycle 8 — executed focused pytest (tests/test_inventory_pytest.py) in a project-local virtualenv (.venv_autopilot).
- Outcome: tests: 1 passed.
- Commit: cdc8b63
- Files changed: tests/test_inventory_pytest.py, AUTOPILOT_STATE.md, ROADMAP.md, logs/AUTOPILOT_LOG.md
- Next: prepare CI wiring for focused tests and a reproducible verifier script for CI/human runs.

## 2026-06-28T03:10:00Z

- Action: Autopilot cycle 4 — added tools/healthcheck.py (ported from scripts/check-health.sh).

- Tests: tests/test_healthcheck.py — 10 PASSED; tests/test_inventory_pytest.py — 1 PASSED; tests/smoke_test.sh — PASSED.
- Commit: dea410f
- Next: Wire tools/healthcheck.py into .github/workflows/smoke.yml and identify next tool in porting queue.

## 2026-06-28T03:20:00Z

- Action: Autopilot cycle 5 — added tools/telegram_notify.py (ported from scripts/send-telegram-alert.sh).
